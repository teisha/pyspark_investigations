Out of rooms, Nick's wife prepares a place for them in a shed under a neon star Nick had just finished hanging. Their plight brings out the generosity in everyone, including Nick, who remembers another family almost two thousand years earlier that also found a makeshift room at an inn under another kind of star.","year":1945,"thumb":"/library/metadata/3537/thumb/1572593952","art":"/library/metadata/3537/art/1572593952","duration":1285800,"originallyAvailableAt":"1945-10-13","addedAt":1449634959,"updatedAt":1572593952,"Media":[{"id":5735,"duration":1285800,"bitrate":4135,"width":768,"height":576,"aspectRatio":1.33,"audioChannels":2,"audioCodec":"aac","videoCodec":"h264","videoResolution":"576","container":"mp4","videoFrameRate":"NTSC","optimizedForStreaming":0,"audioProfile":"lc","has64bitOffsets":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline","Part":[{"id":5735,"key":"/library/parts/5735/1449634959/file.mp4","duration":1285800,"file":"/mnt/nas/video/kids/Christmas/Star In The Night [1945].mp4","size":665654053,"audioProfile":"lc","container":"mp4","has64bitOffsets":false,"indexes":"sd","optimizedForStreaming":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline"}]}],"Genre":[{"tag":"Short"},{"tag":"Family"},{"tag":"Drama"}],"Director":[{"tag":"Don Siegel"}],"Role":[{"tag":"Anthony Caruso"},{"tag":"Claire Du Brey"},{"tag":"Dick Elliott"}]},{"ratingKey":"3548","key":"/library/metadata/3548","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.imdb://tt0208654?lang=en","studio":"Rankin/Bass Productions","type":"movie","title":"'Twas the Night Before Christmas","titleSort":"Twas the Night Before Christmas","contentRating":"TV-G","summary":"When a town learns that Santa Claus has struck it off his delivery schedule due to an insulting letter, a way must be found to change his mind.","rating":7.3,"year":1974,"thumb":"/library/metadata/3548/thumb/1572593960","art":"/library/metadata/3548/art/1572593960","duration":1448967,"originallyAvailableAt":"1974-12-08","addedAt":1450136885,"updatedAt":1572593960,"chapterSource":"agent","primaryExtraKey":"/library/metadata/11715","ratingImage":"imdb://image.rating","Media":[{"id":5746,"duration":1448967,"bitrate":4142,"width":768,"height":576,"aspectRatio":1.33,"audioChannels":2,"audioCodec":"aac","videoCodec":"h264","videoResolution":"576","container":"mp4","videoFrameRate":"NTSC","optimizedForStreaming":0,"audioProfile":"lc","has64bitOffsets":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline","Part":[{"id":5746,"key":"/library/parts/5746/1450136885/file.mp4","duration":1448967,"file":"/mnt/nas/video/kids/Christmas/Twas The Night Before Christmas [1974].mp4","size":751421978,"audioProfile":"lc","container":"mp4","has64bitOffsets":false,"indexes":"sd","optimizedForStreaming":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline"}]}],"Genre":[{"tag":"Short"},{"tag":"Family"},{"tag":"Musical"}],"Director":[{"tag":"Jules Bass"},{"tag":"Arthur Rankin, Jr."}],"Writer":[{"tag":"Jerome Coppersmith"}],"Country":[{"tag":"USA"}],"Role":[{"tag":"George Gobel"},{"tag":"Joel Grey"},{"tag":"John McGiver"}]},{"ratingKey":"3550","key":"/library/metadata/3550","guid":"local://3550","type":"movie","title":"Veggietales Christmas Singalong Songs","summary":"","thumb":"/library/metadata/3550/thumb/1572593963","art":"/library/metadata/3550/art/1572593963","duration":1951514,"addedAt":1449530859,"updatedAt":1572593963,"Media":[{"id":5748,"duration":1951514,"bitrate":4185,"width":768,"height":576,"aspectRatio":1.33,"audioChannels":2,"audioCodec":"aac","videoCodec":"h264","videoResolution":"576","container":"mp4","videoFrameRate":"NTSC","optimizedForStreaming":0,"audioProfile":"lc","has64bitOffsets":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline","Part":[{"id":5748,"key":"/library/parts/5748/1449530859/file.mp4","duration":1951514,"file":"/mnt/nas/video/kids/Christmas/Veggietales - Christmas Singalong Songs.mp4","size":1022604581,"audioProfile":"lc","container":"mp4","has64bitOffsets":false,"indexes":"sd","optimizedForStreaming":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline"}]}]},{"ratingKey":"3551","key":"/library/metadata/3551","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.imdb://tt1817784?lang=en","type":"movie","title":"VeggieTales: It's a Meaningful Life","contentRating":"G","summary":"It was the biggest football game of his life and Stewart (Larry the Cucumber) had a chance to win it all.

Cavis thinks the production will \"teach London how to love\". But children at nearby St. Bart's Church are planning a nativity play for the same evening, and they plan to feature the Star of Christmas, a religious artifact unseen by the public for decades. The London Post Gazette writes a front-page story about the nativity play and the Star, and Cavis and Millward hatch a plan to make their musical better than the children's play.
