It was created and produced by JibJab Bros. Studios and premiered on Netflix on October 7, 2016. Episodes have also been released in full monthly on StoryBots' official YouTube channel.\r\n\r\nStoryBots Super Songs centers on the StoryBots, who are curious little creatures who live in the world beneath our screens. However, while its predecessor Ask the StoryBots follows Beep, Bing, Bang, Boop and Bo as they answer a child’s single question (like “why is the sky blue?”), the music-centric Super Songs has the characters exploring broader subject areas.","index":1,"viewCount":59,"lastViewedAt":1536268574,"year":2016,"thumb":"/library/metadata/29725/thumb/1574088723","art":"/library/metadata/29725/art/1574088723","banner":"/library/metadata/29725/banner/1574088723","duration":1200000,"originallyAvailableAt":"2016-10-07","leafCount":11,"viewedLeafCount":10,"childCount":1,"addedAt":1532641195,"updatedAt":1574088723,"Genre":[{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Children"}]},{"ratingKey":"1974","key":"/library/metadata/1974/children","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://78949?lang=en","studio":"ITV","type":"show","title":"Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends","contentRating":"TV-Y","summary":"","index":1,"rating":8.1,"year":1984,"thumb":"/library/metadata/1974/thumb/1486503960","art":"/library/metadata/1974/art/1486503960","banner":"/library/metadata/1974/banner/1486503960","theme":"/library/metadata/1974/theme/1486503960","duration":420000,"originallyAvailableAt":"1984-09-04","leafCount":4,"viewedLeafCount":0,"childCount":4,"addedAt":1411934207,"updatedAt":1486503960,"Genre":[{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Children"}],"Role":[{"tag":"Michael Angelis"},{"tag":"Alec Baldwin"},{"tag":"Michael Brandon"}]},{"ratingKey":"1983","key":"/library/metadata/1983/children","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://256532?lang=en","studio":"PBS","type":"show","title":"Wild Animal Baby Explorers","summary":"","index":1,"year":2010,"thumb":"/library/metadata/1983/thumb/1486503952","art":"/library/metadata/1983/art/1486503952","banner":"/library/metadata/1983/banner/1486503952","duration":1800000,"originallyAvailableAt":"2010-10-01","leafCount":5,"viewedLeafCount":0,"childCount":1,"addedAt":1381084992,"updatedAt":1486503952,"Genre":[{"tag":"Children"}]},{"ratingKey":"38898","key":"/library/metadata/38898/children","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://82018?lang=en","studio":"BBC Two","type":"show","title":"Wild China","contentRating":"TV-G","summary":"Created in co-operation with China's own national broadcast service, Wild China examines the country's rarely documented range of wildlife.\r\n\r\nTake a look at some of China's most impressive natural sites such as the ancient Han kingdom, the Mongol steppes, the Silk Road and the Tibetan Plateau.","index":1,"rating":9.4,"year":2008,"thumb":"/library/metadata/38898/thumb/1559954884","art":"/library/metadata/38898/art/1559954884","banner":"/library/metadata/38898/banner/1559954884","theme":"/library/metadata/38898/theme/1559954884","duration":3600000,"originallyAvailableAt":"2008-05-12","leafCount":7,"viewedLeafCount":0,"childCount":2,"addedAt":1559954844,"updatedAt":1559954884,"Genre":[{"tag":"Documentary"}],"Role":[{"tag":"Bernard Hill"}]},{"ratingKey":"38804","key":"/library/metadata/38804/children","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://78992?lang=en","studio":"BBC One","type":"show","title":"Wildlife Specials","summary":"Occasional series of one-off documentaries, each examining the lifestyle of a particular animal.","index":1,"rating":9.3,"year":1995,"thumb":"/library/metadata/38804/thumb/1559951523","art":"/library/metadata/38804/art/1559951523","banner":"/library/metadata/38804/banner/1559951523","duration":3600000,"originallyAvailableAt":"1995-04-14","leafCount":8,"viewedLeafCount":0,"childCount":2,"addedAt":1559951416,"updatedAt":1559951523,"Genre":[{"tag":"Documentary"}]},{"ratingKey":"1990","key":"/library/metadata/1990/children","guid":"com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://215961?lang=en","studio":"BBC Two","type":"show","title":"Words and Pictures: Fun with Phonics","summary":"Literacy series for four- to six-year-olds using phonics, presented by Pui Fan Lee and Will Vanderpuye.","index":1,"thumb":"/library/metadata/1990/thumb/1493775789","art":"/library/metadata/1990/art/1493775789","banner":"/library/metadata/1990/banner/1493775789","duration":300000,"leafCount":3,"viewedLeafCount":0,"childCount":1,"addedAt":1395000477,"updatedAt":1493775789,"Genre":[{"tag":"Children"},{"tag":"Special Interest"}]}]}}
