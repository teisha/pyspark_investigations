The result is a unique and unrepeatable event, since many of the eyewitnesses captured on film did not have long left to live. Each hour-long programme is carefully structured to focus on a key theme or campaign, from the rise of Nazi Germany to Hitler's downfall and the onset of the Cold War. There are no academic \"talking heads\" here to spell out an official version of history; the narration, delivered with wonderful gravitas by Sir Laurence Olivier, is kept to a minimum. The show's great coup was to allow the participants to speak for themselves. Painstaking research in the archives of the Imperial War Museum also unearthed a vast quantity of newsreel footage, including on occasion the cameraman's original raw rushes which present an unvarnished and never-before-seen picture of important events. Carl Davis' impressive score underlines the grand scale of the enterprise.","index":1,"rating":9.1,"viewCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1502820058,"year":1973,"thumb":"/library/metadata/26636/thumb/1559952062","art":"/library/metadata/26636/art/1559952062","banner":"/library/metadata/26636/banner/1559952062","theme":"/library/metadata/26636/theme/1559952062","duration":3600000,"originallyAvailableAt":"1973-10-31","leafCount":35,"viewedLeafCount":1,"childCount":2,"addedAt":1502736543,"updatedAt":1559952062,"Genre":[{"tag":"Documentary"},{"tag":"Mini-Series"},{"tag":"Special Interest"}],"Role":[{"tag":"Laurence Olivier"}]}]}}
